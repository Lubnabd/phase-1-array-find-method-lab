/*
Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:

The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
Each object has two properties: year and result
It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined
*/

function superbowlWin(record) {
    const winningGame = record.find(game => game.result === "W");
    return winningGame ? winningGame.year :undefined
  }
  
 
  const superBowlGames = [
    { year: 2000, result: "L" },
    { year: 2001, result: "W" },
    { year: 2002, result: "L" },
  ];
  
  const winningYear = superbowlWin(superBowlGames);
  console.log(winningYear);
